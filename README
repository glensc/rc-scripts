CRITICAL THINGS
If you want use this rc-scripts remember to compile:
- Kernel/User netlink socket
support into your kernel. This is very important ! Without
this network scripts will fail.

STANDARD THINGS
If you want use IPv6 networking remember to compile:
- The IPv6 protocol (EXPERIMENTAL) 
- IPv6: enable EUI-64 token format
- IPv6: disable provider based addresses
into your kernel (last two options are optional) !
