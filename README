rc-scripts is a derivative of the initscripts 3.78 release by
RedHat Software, but with bugs removed and newer features added.

You need packages such as: mktemp, modutils (at least 2.1.121),
textutils, sh-utils, mawk (at least 1.3.3; other awk
implementations are not tested), procps, sed, e2fsprogs,
gettext to use rc-scripts.

If you want to use networking with rc-scripts you need
compile few features such as:

Networking options  --->
	 [*] Kernel/User netlink socket
	 [*]   Routing messages

into your kernel and install Alexey Kuznetsov iproute2 package.
To use IPv6 networking you should compile:

Networking options  --->
	<*/M>   The IPv6 protocol (EXPERIMENTAL)
	 [*]      IPv6: enable EUI-64 token format     
	 [*]        IPv6: disable provider based addresses 

too. IPX support require ncpfs package; fourtun (v4 over v6
tunneling) support require fourtun package and fourtun kernel
module; bridge support require bridge-utils.

Also you should know that format of interface configuration
files is totally different from these used in RedHat/Mandrake
initscripts.

If you have some bug reports or suggestions please send email
to rc-scripts maintainers at <pld-rc-scripts@pld.org.pl> or
use our Bug Tracking System ( http://bugs.pld.org.pl/ ).
