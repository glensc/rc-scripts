rc-scripts is a derivative of the initscripts 3.78 release by
RedHat Software, but with bugs removed and newer features added.

To use rc-scripts you need packages such as: mktemp, modutils
(at least 2.1.121), textutils, sh-utils, mawk (at least 1.3.3;
other awk implementations are not tested), procps, sed, e2fsprogs,
gettext.

If you want to use networking with rc-scripts you need
compile few features such as:

Networking options  --->
	 [*] Kernel/User netlink socket
	 [*]   Routing messages

into your kernel and install Alexey Kuznetsov iproute2 package.
To use IPv6 networking you should compile:

Networking options  --->
	<*/M>   The IPv6 protocol (EXPERIMENTAL)
	 [*]      IPv6: enable EUI-64 token format     
	 [*]        IPv6: disable provider based addresses 

too. 

Other required or suggested packages:

| What?       | Package                       |
+-------------+-------------------------------+
  IPX		ncfps
  fourtun	fourtun and kernel module
  bridge	bridge-utils
  wireless	wireless-tools
  IrDA		irda-utils
  serial/ppp	ppp, dip, wvdial
  serial/slip	slattach
  PPPoE		pppd + rp-pppoe (plugin or userspace program)
  
Also you should know that format of interface configuration
files is totally different from these used in RedHat/Mandrake
initscripts and even from stable rc-scripts branch.

If you have some bug reports or suggestions please send email
to rc-scripts maintainers at <pld-rc-scripts@pld-linux.org> or
