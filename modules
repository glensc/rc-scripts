# /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.
# $Id$
#
# This file should contain the names of kernel modules that are
# to be loaded at boot time, one per line with extra args treated as modprobe
# options.
#
# Comments begin with a `#', and everything on the line after them are ignored.
#
# You can also have /etc/modules.X.Y and /etc/modules.X.Y.Z, where X.Y.Z are kernel version numbers
# The modules files are preocessed in exactly that order too.
