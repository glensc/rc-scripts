Important:
- don't set any flags automatically; always follow user
  suggestion (multicast, arp)
- merge baggins changes in atm-rc (added support for RFC1483/2684 Bridged
  protocol)

Not realy important but mayby nice:
- Add checking for privileges during restarting
  and if they are not enough say fuck off in a
  nice way.


Other:
- maybe merge ATM rc scripts

We are waiting for suggestions.
