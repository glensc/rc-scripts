$Id: TODO,v 1.14 2001/05/15 16:03:33 baggins Exp $

Features missing:
- IPSec (freeswan) support
- NLS with national characters support

Important:
- don't set any flags automaticly; always follow user
  suggestion (multicast, arp)
- MTU for ethernet
- merge baggins changes in atm-rc (added support for RFC1483/2684 Bridged
  protocol)

Not realy important but mayby nice:
- Add checing for preveliges during restarting 
  and if thay are not enought say fuck off in a 
  nice way.

  
Other:
- maybe merge ATM rc scripts

We are waiting for suggestions.
