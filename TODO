Important:
- don't set any flags automatically; always follow user
  suggestion (multicast, arp)
- merge baggins changes in atm-rc (added support for RFC1483/2684 Bridged
  protocol)
- killproc() sucks and has no consistency, error reporting
  you'll never know which side of PROCNAME you should add the --waitforname or -SIGNAL args
  because if you put -SIGNAL at wrong side of PROGNAME it will enter infinitive loop:
    killproc -TERM --waitforname slapd --waitfortime 300 slapd
  if you put --waitforname at wrong side, it will just ignore them:
    killproc slapd -TERM --waitforname slapd --waitfortime 300 
  while correct would be:
    killproc --waitforname slapd --waitfortime 300 slapd -TERM
- switch to use __umount_*loop instead of own umount loop when stopping system

Not realy important but maybe nice:
- Add checking for privileges during restarting
  and if they are not enough say fuck off in a
  nice way.

Other:
- maybe merge ATM rc scripts

We are waiting for suggestions.
