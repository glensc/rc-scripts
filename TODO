Features missing:
- IPSec (freeswan) support
- NLS with national characters support (soon)

Important:
- don't set any flags automaticly; always follow user
  suggestion (multicast, arp)

Other:
- make ONBOOT=yes default (user should be allowed to specify
 ,,no'' of course)

We are waiting for suggestions.
