### IPV4 NETWORKING

# Disables IPv4 packet forwarding
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

# Enables source route verification
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1

# Accept ICMP redirect messages (suggested 1 for hosts and 0 for routers)
# net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 1

# Accept source routed packages (suggested 0 for hosts and 1 for routers)
# net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 1

# Log packets with source addresses with no known route to kernel log
# net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1

# Do multicast routing ? The kernel needs to be compiled with
# CONFIG_MROUTE and a multicast routing daemon is required.
# net.ipv4.conf.all.mc_forwarding = 1

# If you get message "Neighbour table overflow" try to play with this values.
# Needed in huge networks. These example values are sufficent in networks with
# mask 21.
# net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3 = 4096
# net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2 = 2048

# Do proxy ARP ?
# net.ipv4.conf.all.proxy_arp = 1

# Accept ICMP redirect messages only for gateways, listed in
# default gateway list ?
# net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects = 1

# Send ICMP redirects to other hosts ?
# net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 1

# Ignore all ICMP echo requests ? 
# net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1

# Ignore ICMP echo requests to broadcast and multicast addresses ?
# net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

# Enable MTU discovery patch ? (KERNEL MUST SUPPORT THIS)
# MTU (maximal transfer unit) is the size of the chunks we send out
# over the net. "Path MTU Discovery" means that, instead of always
# sending very small chunks, we start out sending big ones and if we
# then discover that some host along the way likes its chunks smaller,
# we adjust to a smaller size.
# net.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc = 1

# Enable debugging of IP masquerading ?
# net.ipv4.ip_masq_debug = 1

# Bug-to-bug compatibility with some broken printers. On retransmit
# try to send bigger packets to work around bugs in certain TCP
# stacks. Can be turned off by setting IPV4_RETRANS_COLLAPSE to ,,yes''. 
# net.ipv4.tcp_retrans_collapse = 1
	 
# Disable select acknowledgments after RFC2018 ?
# TCP may experience poor performance when multiple packets are lost
# from one window of data. With the limited information available
# from cumulative acknowledgments, a TCP sender can only learn about a
# single lost packet per round trip time. An aggressive sender could
# choose to retransmit packets early, but such retransmitted segments
# may have already been successfully received.
# net.ipv4.tcp_sack = 0

# Disable timestamps as defined in RFC1323 ?
# Timestamps are designed to provide compatible interworking with
# TCP's that do not implement the TCP Extensions for High Performance
# net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0

# Enable the strict RFC793 interpretation of the TCP urgent pointer field.
# net.ipv4.tcp_stdurg = 1

# Enable tcp_syncookies
# net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

# Disable window scaling as defined in RFC1323 ?
# The window scale extension expands the definition of the TCP
# window to 32 bits and then uses a scale factor to carry this
# 32-bit value in the 16-bit Window field of the TCP header.
# net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 0

# Enable dynamic socket address rewriting on interface address change.
# This is useful for dialup interface with changing IP addresses.
# sys.net.ipv4.ip_dynaddr = 7

# Range of ports used by TCP and UDP to choose the local
# port. Contains two numbers, the first number is the lowest port,
# the second number the highest local port. Default is "1024 4999".
# Should be changed to "32768 61000" for high-usage systems.
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 4096 61000

# Disables automatic defragmentation (needed for masquerading, LVS)
# Non existant on Linux 2.4
# net.ipv4.ip_always_defrag = 0

### IPV6 NETWORKING

# Disables IPv6 packet forwarding
# net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 0

# Do you want IPv6 address autoconfiguration? Kernel default is yes.
# net.ipv6.conf.all.autoconf = 0
# net.ipv6.conf.default.autoconf = 0

# Do you want kernel to add default route for IPv6 interfaces if
# there is no router on the link? Kernel default is yes.
# Kernel 2.4.0-test? or later (after ANK accepts my patch - baggins).
# net.ipv6.conf.all.autoconf_route = 0

### OTHER SETTINGS

# Adjust number of inodes and file handles available in the system.
# If you have a havily loaded system and kernel complains about
# file/inode limit reached in VFS, increase this 2x. The default
# value is 4096 (file) and 8192 (inode). The inode number should be
# always 2-3 times the file number. For most systems this should not
# be changed
# fs.file-max = 8192
