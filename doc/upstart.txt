===================================
Upstart event-based service startup
===================================

This version of rc-scripts support Upstart event-based service startup. This
can co-exist with old-style startup scripts.

Enabling/disabling event-base service startup
---------------------------------------------

Upstart event-based service startup may be disabled on boot time
by using a ``pld.no-upstart`` kernel command-line option.

An init script may be called with ``USE_UPSTART=no`` environment variable
to disable special upstart-related processing – this way one may use
``/etc/rc.d/init.d/$service start`` to start a service even if upstart job
for that service is present. The ``/sbin/service`` script has two new options
``--upstart`` and ``--no-upstart`` to force new- or old-style service control.

``USE_UPSTART=no`` can also be places in ``/etc/sysconfig/system``
configuration file, though it can break ``*-upstart`` packages
installation/removal a bit.

Available events
----------------

Ubuntu-compatible system events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

all-swaps
        when swaps from ``/etc/fstab`` are activated

filesystem
        when basic filesystem hierarchy (FHS) is mounted
        NOTE: currently it doesn't wait for network filesystems!

local-filesystems
        when all local filesystems are mounted and initialized

root-filesystem
        when root filesystem is mounted r/w and initialized

virtual-filesystems
        when virtual filesystems (/proc, /sys, etc.) are mounted

PLD-specific system events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pld.sysinit-done
        when rc.sysinit finished its job

pld.shutdown-started
        when rc.shutdown starts

pld.network-starting
        just before network initialization is started

pld.network-started
        when network is initialized

pld.network-stopping
        just before network shutdown is started

pld.network-stopped
        when network configuration is shut down

Jobs
~~~~

The standard Upstart events are available for job control:
starting(7) started(7) stopping(7) stopped(7)  (see man pages)

As relying on job name is not good enough when several alternative
implementations of a service are available. In such case
each of the alternative jobs should have an extra 'SERVICE_syslog=y'
variable exported. In van then be used like this::

  start on started SERVICE_syslog=y

Please note that using 'SERVICE=something' will not work, as the value
will be inherited by any other job with 'export SERVICE'.

Job events and enabling/disabling event-base service startup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please note that relying on events not raised by PLD service jobs
or scripts (like 'startup') will make job ignore the 'pld.no-upstart'
setting.


Writing Upstart job descriptions
--------------------------------

Job description files in ``/etc/init`` are not only the recipes to start
a service, but also configuration files for that service. Keep that in mind
when writing the ``*.conf`` files. No complicated logic, that can change from
a release to a release, should be implemented there, the script should be
readable, basic configuration settings easy to find and no upstart-controlled
settings (like resource limit)  reimplemented in the script or started daemon
arguments.

The syntax of the ``/etc/init/*.conf`` files is described in the init(5) man
page.

Instead of using ``/etc/sysconfig/$service`` files put the service
configuration directly into the ``*.conf`` file. When 'env' stanza is used for
that, the value may be overridden when starting the job with initctl.

Simple example, the job description for syslog-ng::

  start on pld.network-started
  stop on pld.shutdown-started

  env SERVICE=syslog
  export SERVICE

  respawn

  console output

  exec /usr/sbin/syslog-ng -F -f /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf

Checking upstart configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Upstart 1.3 one can check current configuration with::

  initctl check-config

Also, with an 'initctl2dot' tool the configuration may be visualised in
a graphical diagram.

Tracking startup progress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to run a program from an upstart job is to ``exec`` it
the way it will stay in foreground (that is what is the ``-F`` option in the
example above for). However, when process is started this way Upstart cannot
differentiate before the ``program starting failed`` and ``program has
terminated`` cases. It will also assumed the job has started as soon as the
command has been executed and that may be not what other jobs wait for.

A 'proper daemon' first checks command line arguments and configuration, then
forks two times and returns with success only when the child process is ready.
Upstart can handle such daemons with ``expect daemon`` stanza. So, to manage
such daemon via Upstart, exec so it daemonize and use ``expect daemon``
directive to tell Upstart what happens. Unfortunately, when ``expect daemon``
is used and the process forks only once or does some more weird thing, Upstart
job may lock up. Also, libdaemon-based daemons don't play well with ``expect
daemon``.

When the service forks once ``expect fork`` should be used instead.

There is also an ``expect stop`` option, probably the most elegant way to
track process startup. The process doesn't have to fork in this case and
Upstart doesn't have to track that forking. The process should raise SIGSTOP
when it is ready – only then Upstart will emit the job's ``started`` event and
let the process continue. Unfortunately, currently hardly anything supports
this interface.

When no ``expect`` stanza will help and we need to properly wait for process
startup, then ``post-start`` script must be used. See the init(5) man page for
details.

Debuging jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Making sure job description is correct and Upstart will properly manage the
process may be tricky. One way to check if the job was described and started
properly is to use ``pstree -p`` command and compare it to ``initctl status``
output. Example::

  # initctl status cherokee
  cherokee start/running, process 22419

  # pstree -p
  init(1)─┬─Terminal(19446)─┬─bash(8983)───console(9003)
        ....
          |-bacula-sd(3514)---{bacula-sd}(3520)
          |-cherokee(22419)-+-cherokee-worker(22423)-+-rrdtool(22425)
          |                 |                        |-{cherokee-worker}(22424)
          |                 |                        |-{cherokee-worker}(22426)
          |                 |                        |-{cherokee-worker}(22427)
          |                 |                        |-{cherokee-worker}(22428)
          |                 |                        |-{cherokee-worker}(22429)
          |                 |                        |-{cherokee-worker}(22430)
          |                 |                        |-{cherokee-worker}(22431)
          |                 |                        |-{cherokee-worker}(22432)
          |                 |                        |-{cherokee-worker}(22433)
          |                 |                        `-{cherokee-worker}(22434)
          |                 `-{cherokee}(22422)
          |-conserver(3471)---conserver(3477)
        ....


As you can see, Upstart thinks the main process of 'cherokee' is '22419',
and indeed this is the only 'cherokee' child of init. So this state is correct.

Common problem that may appear in pstree output:

  1. The main process pid differs from what Upstart thinks. That usually
     happens when bad 'expect fork' or 'expect daemon' is used. May cause
     Upstart lock-up when the PID reported by ``initctl status`` does not exist
     at all.

  2. Init has multiple children processes for one job instance. It may happen
     when previously running job was not properly killed, when bad 'expect' was
     used or when the daemon does weird forking on startup.

Updating init scripts
---------------------

Parts of the system will still expect ``service $name`` or even, directly,
``/etc/rc.d/init.d/$name`` scripts working. Also, LSB expects compatible
init scripts in /etc/init.d. For this still to work, an upstart-controlled
service is expected to have its ``/etc/rc.d/init.d/$name`` script also present.
It must also be named exactly as the main upstart job for the service.

The script must be a bit modified (in comparison to the traditional init
scripts) to make use of the upstart features.

For the start/stop/status/reload commands to work the script should include a
``upstart_controlled`` command placed before commands are handled (and after
``/etc/rc.d/init.d/function`` was included). This command (shell alias actually)
will be ignored when upstart boot control is disabled or no upstart job is
available for the service. Otherwise it will implement the basic LSB commands
and exit.

Sometimes some commands must be implemented in a special way (not all services
may understand SIGHUP as a signal to reload their configuration) or extra
commands are provided (like 'configtest'). In such case ``upstart_controlled``
should be given a list of commands to implement or, preferrably, ``--except``
and the list of commands which stay implemented in the script. If the first
argument of the script is one to be of the 'not upstart_controlled' commands,
processing will continue past 'upstart_controlled' call and the commands may
be handled by the init script.

When ``configtest`` is includes in the ``upstart_controlled --except`` list
then ``$script configtest`` will be called before each restart/reload attempt,
but only when done by ``/sbin/service`` or call to the script. Direct initctl
calls are not affected.

The minimal init script, for a service which will be controlled by upstart
only would be::

  #!/bin/sh

  . /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions

  upstart_controlled

  echo "Service available only via upstart boot"
  exit 3

Minimal change to an existing PLD script to handle upstart control is to add::

  upstart_controlled

before the usual::

  RETVAL=0
  # See how we were called.
  case "$1" in
    start)

Sometimes other upstart jobs will rely on a service started by the traditional
init script. In such case, the script should emit appropriate events.

e.g.::

	msg_starting "syslog-ng"
	emit starting JOB=syslog-ng SERVICE=syslog
	daemon /usr/sbin/syslog-ng -f /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf $OPTIONS
	emit started JOB=syslog-ng SERVICE=syslog
	RETVAL=$?

The ``emit`` function does nothing when upstart-controlled boot is disabled (not
to trigger any upstart jobs), otherwise it calls ``/sbin/initctl emit``
