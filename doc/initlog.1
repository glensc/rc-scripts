.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinitlog\fR logs messages and events to the system logger.
It is mainly designed for use in init scripts. initlog
reads a configuration file

by default, to determine its settings. Any line preceded with a 
.I #
is a comment, and the following configuration directives
are recognized:
.TP
.I facility <logging facility>
Sets the default logging facility
.TP
.I priority <logging priority>

.TP
.I ignore <regexp>
Messages that match the regular expression will not be logged.

initlog behavior can also be configured by command-line options.
