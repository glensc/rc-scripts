Files in /etc/sysconfig
=======================

/etc/sysconfig/clock:

  deprecated values from earlier releases:

    CLOCKMODE=GMT indicates that the clock is set to UTC
    CLOCKMODE=ARC on alpha only indicates the ARC console's
      42-year time offset is in effect

  currently correct values:

    UTC=true indicates that the clock is set to UTC; anything
      else indicates that it is set to local time
    ARC=true on alpha only indicates the ARC console's
      42-year time offset is in effect; otherwise the normal
      Unix epoch is assumed


/etc/sysconfig/keyboard:

  KEYTABLE=<keytable file>
  for example: KEYTABLE="/usr/lib/kbd/keytables/us.map"

/etc/sysconfig/mouse:

  MOUSETYPE=microsoft|mouseman|mousesystems|ps/2|msbm|logibm|atibm|
    logitech|mmseries|mmhittab
  XEMU3=yes|no (emulate three buttons with two buttons whenever
    necessary, most notably in X)

  In addition, /dev/mouse points to the mouse device.

/etc/sysconfig/network:

  NETWORKING=yes|no
  IPV4_NETWORKING=yes|no
  IPV6_NETWORKING=yes|no
  HOSTNAME=<whatever hostname you want, e.g. "pldmachine">
    Note: for compatibility with some old software people might
    install (like trn), the /etc/HOSTNAME file should contain the
    same value as here.
  NISDOMAIN=<nis domain name, e.g. "mydomain.org">
    Note: set this only if you use NIS system. DNS domainname 
    should be set in /etc/resolv.conf
  IGNORE_ICMP_BCAST_IPV4=yes|no (Please note that if you accept ICMP echo
    requests with a broadcast/multicast destination address your network
    may be used as an exploder for denial of service packet flooding attacks
   to other hosts.
  SPOOFING_IPV4=yes|no (anti spoofing protection)
  GATEWAY=<gateway IP>
  GATEWAYDEV=<gateway device> (e.g. eth0)
  IPX=yes|no
  IPXAUTOPRIMARY=on|off (note, that MUST be on|off, not yes|no)
  IPXAUTOFRAME=on|off (again, not yes|no)
  IPXINTERNALNETNUM=<netnum>
  IPXINTERNALNODENUM=<nodenum>

  All the IPX stuff is optional, and should default to off.

/etc/sysconfig/static-nat

  Configuration file for static Network Address Translation (NAT).
  Contains lines of the form:

    <address> via <addressreal>

  NAT will translate address <address> to <addressreal>.

/etc/sysconfig/static-routes:

  Contains lines of the form:

    <device> to [type] <network>/<prefix> via <gateway>

  <device> may be a device name to have the route brought up and
  down with the device, or "any" to have the correct devices calculated
  at run time. [type] is optional. RH style isn't supported !

  Also you can set few options after "<gateway>":
    tos <tos>
    metric <number>
    table <table>
    src <address>
    realm <realmid>
    mtu <mtu> or mtu lock <mtu>
    window <number>
    rtt <number>
    nexthop <nexthop>
    scope <scope>
    protocol <rtproto>
    onlink
    equalize
  For more informations see iproute2 documentation .

/etc/sysconfig/routed:

  SILENT=yes|no
  EXPORT_GATEWAY=yes|no

/etc/sysconfig/pcmcia:

  PCMCIA=yes|no
  PCIC=i82365|tcic
  PCIC_OPTS=<socket driver (i82365 or tcic) timing parameters>
  CORE_OPTS=<pcmcia_core options>
  CARDMGR_OPTS=<cardmgr options>

/etc/sysconfig/amd:

  ADIR=/.automount  (normally never changed)
  MOUNTPTS='/net /etc/amd.conf'  (standard automount stuff)
  AMDOPTS=  (extra options for AMD)

/etc/sysconfig/tape:

  DEV=/dev/nst0
    Tape device.  Use the non-rewinding one for these scripts.
  
    For SCSI tapes this is /dev/nst#, where # is the number of the
    tape drive you want to use.  If you only have one then use
    nst0.
 
    For IDE tapes you use /dev/ht#, where # is the number of the tape
    drive you want to use (usually ht0).
 
    For floppy tape drives use /dev/ftape.

  ADMIN=root
    Person to mail to if the backup fails for any reason

  SLEEP=5
    Time to sleep between tape operations.  Some drives need a bit
    more than others, but 5 seems to work for 8mm, 4mm, and DLT

  BLOCKSIZE=32768
    This worked fine for 8mm, then 4mm, and now DLT.  An optimal
    setting is probably however much data your drive writes at one
    time.

  SHORTDATE=$(date +%y:%m:%d:%H:%M)
    A short date string, used in backup log filenames.

  DAY=$(date +log-%y:%m:%d)
    This is used for the log file directory.

  DATE=$(date)
    Regular date string, used in log files.

  LOGROOT=/var/log/backup
    Root of the logging directory

  LIST=$LOGROOT/incremental-list
    This is the file name the incremental backup will use to store
    the incremental list.  It will be $LIST-{some number}.

  DOTCOUNT=$LOGROOT/.count
    For counting as you go to know which incremental list to use

  COUNTER=$LOGROOT/counter-file
    For rewinding when done...might not use.

  BACKUPTAB=/etc/backuptab
    The file in which we keep our list of backup(s) we want to make.

/etc/sysconfig/sendmail:
  DAEMON=yes|no
    yes implies -bd
  QUEUE=1h
    given to sendmail as -q$QUEUE
    -q option is not given to sendmail if /etc/sysconfig/sendmail
    exists and QUEUE is empty or undefined.

/etc/sysconfig/i18n

  LANG= can be any two letter ISO language code
  LC_ALL= is the setting of the localedata configuration (eg fr_CA)
  LINGUAS= can be a : separated list of language codes
  SYSTERM= use to set default TERM environment variable

  The above three variables are used in rc.sysinit.

  SYSFONT= any font that is legal when used as
	/usr/sbin/setfont $SYSFONT ...
    (See kbd package for sysfont command)

  UNIMAP= any unicode font that is legal fodder for
	/usr/sbin/setfont $SYSFONT-u $UNIMAP

  The above is used by the /sbin/setsysfont command (which is run
  by rc.sysinit at boot time).
