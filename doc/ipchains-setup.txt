This is part of PLD rc-scripts

Package ipchains-setup is used to easyly setup and maintain IP firewall
rules in PLD system. It uses, of course, ipchains utility.

Firewall configuration is stored in /etc/sysconfig/ipchains file (default
policies) and in /etc/sysconfig/ipchains.d directory. The directory
contains files with rules. One file for one (user-defined or system)
chain. Empty lines or those starting with "#" or ";" are ignored. The
rest after shell substitutions are passed as argumets to ipchains.

Lines in chain files are not divided into field (like files used by
firewall-setup package used to be), because most of ipchains rules would
have most of those fields empty.
